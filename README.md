# conway-game-of-life

Conway's Game of Life React App.  A quick coding challenge.

## A brief description

First, this came to be during a two Friday algorithm challenges.  The first was to build Conway's Game of Life in the terminal.

We tackled this by first creating a function that would determine if a cell was going to live or die based on the life or death status of its neighbors. Then we created a function that updated the board by calling the live or die function on every cell.

This was great fun once all the bugs were squashed

A few days later, I cleaned up the program a bit.

Then, a month and a half later, a new challenge was put to the class.  Take your Conway code and use it to control a React App.  I whipped up the app rather quickly so that now a screen of html elements is controlled through state.  The state is determined by running the Conway Game of Life code, controlled by a couple of buttons.

This is just a sample of the study on algorithms completed at DigitalCrafts.  Every Friday was a new challenge, which is great!  I enjoy algorithms and data structures, and have completed several courses and extra work related to them.

Fun!
